I'm a software engineer with 3 years of experience.

I am a person with a desire to study and experience many things. Currently, I'm a software developer working with [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/). I love building delightful software that improves the lives of people around me.
